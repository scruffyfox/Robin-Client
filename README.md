#Robin - Android Client

This is the main Android client (Robin) for the App.net service. It was originally created by [Callum Taylor](http://callumtaylor.net) and [Romain Piel](http://romainpiel.com/), with [Damian Gribben](https://twitter.com/simpleline) as designer. Romain left development in the end of 2012 and Callum and Damian continued development until its shutdown in mid 2014.

There are 2 main versions of the app, the "v1" client was the only version to be launched onto Google Play. After moderate success, the app underwent a complete re-write in an attempt to fix the major bugs in the app and revamp the design to comply more with 4.0+ design guidelines. (Techincally v3) version 2 of the app began late 2013 and continued until the shutdown. You can read more about the shutdown [here](https://github.com/scruffyfox/Robin-Blog/blob/master/public/posts/End%20of%20an%20Era.md).

There should be no sensitive data in the source code, but if there is, please let me know!

The code is provided as-is and has not been maintained for 8 months and **will** be incompatible with latest IDEs.

Version 1 of the app is only compatibile with Eclipse, where as version 2 was built using Android Studio version 0.4 and Gradle 0.9.

You **may not** fork the project, rename and sell it as-is. Please don't do this, I put nearly 2 years worth of work into it, at least improve on it, and if you do wish to sell an app based on this code, please think of me and maybe give me something in return.

##Disclaimer

I do not claim for any of this work to be good, or useful, simply open sourcing it in case other people wish to make use of it.

As with the GPL, you may use the code for commercial use, but dont just fork the entire project and re-release it under a different name, that would make you a dick.
